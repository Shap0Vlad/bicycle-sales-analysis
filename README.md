Bicycle Sales Analysis

Exploratory analysis of bicycle sales data with a focus on data cleaning, aggregation, and dashboard creation using Excel and Google Sheets.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in:
- data cleaning and preparation
- working with multiple related tables
- building analytical summaries and dashboards
- using Excel and Google Sheets for business-oriented analysis

The dataset consists of several related tables:
- Transactions — individual sales transactions
- Customers — customer profile information
- Address — geographical data linked to customers
- NewCustomerList — information about newly acquired customers
